## Charts

### [dependency-track](https://github.com/MediaMarktSaturn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/dependency-track)

The [OWASP Dependency-Track](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-track/) project with separate deployments for API-server and frontend.

### [pod-cleanup](https://github.com/MediaMarktSaturn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/pod-cleanup)

A CronJob that deletes terminated/failed pods from a Kubernetes cluster.

Useful when e.g. provisioning Google Kubernetes Engine clusters with preemptible nodes. The preemption leads to pods being shut down during node recreation, however the pods are still kept and displayed when listing them.

### [http-metronome](https://github.com/MediaMarktSaturn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/http-metronome)

Creates CronJobs for periodic triggering of cluster-internal http endpoints using GET.

Can be used in an Istio meshed environment, see its [values](https://github.com/MediaMarktSaturn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/http-metronome/values.yaml) for details.

## [application](https://github.com/MediaMarktSaturn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/application)

A generic chart, that creates a deployment with lots of valuable companions for configuration, service meshes or automated canary deployments.
We're using this for lots of our business applications.

Please have a look on the [values](https://github.com/MediaMarktSaturn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/application/values.yaml) for all its features.
